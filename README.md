# Godamlah_comp_project  

This is my first AI project using the JamAI base, which I developed for the **GODAMLah Competition 2024**, powered by **DATASONIC**.  

## Project Overview  

ChatGuardAI is a conversational monitoring tool that uses JamAI to detect harmful, toxic, or illegal content in real-time messages. The bot flags inappropriate behavior and provides detailed analysis reports for flagged messages.  

## Features  

- **Harmful Content Detection**: Identifies harmful messages based on analysis through JamAI.  
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates reports for flagged messages, including labels, severity levels, and explanations.  
- **Customizable Alerts**: Notifies users in real time when harmful content is detected.  
- **JamAI Integration**: Leverages the power of JamAI's table-based processing for enhanced analysis.  

## Key Technologies  

- **JamAI**: For advanced message analysis and classification.  
- **Telegram Bot API**: To provide an interface for real-time interaction.  
- **Python (Asyncio)**: For efficient event handling and integration.  

## Installation  

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.  
- A Telegram bot created through [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to get your bot's API key.  
- A JamAI Base account with API key and project ID.  

### Steps  

1. **Clone this repository**:  

   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Godamlah_comp_project.git  
   cd Godamlah_comp_project  
   ```  

2. **Install the required Python dependencies**:  

   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Set up your JamAI credentials**:  

   - Open the `chatguard_ai.py` file.  
   - Replace `add your JamAI Base api key` with your JamAI API key.  
   - Replace `add your JamAI Base project id` with your JamAI project ID.  

4. **Set up your Telegram Bot API key**:  

   - Replace `7348521172:AAFRrJdL1hMXymkW4VeawQJ15HwdeF3VtQc` in the `chatguard_ai.py` file with your Telegram bot's API key.  

5. **Run the bot**:  

   ```bash  
   python chatguard_ai.py  
   ```  

6. **Start interacting with your bot** on Telegram. Search for your bot's name in the Telegram app and start a chat.  

## Commands  

- **/start**: Sends a welcome message to the user.  
- **/givereport**: Generates a detailed report of the most recent harmful message flagged by the bot.  

## JamAI Table Setup  

Ensure you have the following table configured in JamAI for processing messages:  

- **Table Name**: `ChatGuardAI_3.0`  
- **Fields Required**:  
  - `Message` (text field for input messages)  
  - `Label` (classification output indicating harmful or not)  
  - `Level` (severity level of the message)  
  - `Report` (detailed analysis or explanation)  

Refer to JamAI‚Äôs documentation to set up and configure tables properly.  

## Example Interaction  

1. User sends a message in a Telegram chat.  
2. ChatGuardAI analyzes the message through JamAI.  
3. If harmful content is detected, the bot sends an alert:  

   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Harmful Message Report:  
   üè∑Ô∏è Label: Harmful  
   üìù Message: "This is an example of a toxic message."  
   üìà Level: High  
   
   Type /givereport for a detailed analysis.  
   ```  

4. The user can type `/givereport` to receive a detailed explanation of why the message was flagged.

### Instructions for Users  

1. **Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed**:  
   Check your version using:  
   ```bash  
   python --version  
   ```  

2. **Create a Telegram bot**:  
   - Go to [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in Telegram.  
   - Use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.  
   - Copy the API token provided.  

3. **Set up JamAI**:  
   - Sign up at JamAI Base and create a project.  
   - Create a table named `ChatGuardAI_3.0` with the required fields.  
   - Obtain your API key and project ID.  

4. **Run the bot locally**:  
   After setup, run the bot and start sending messages in Telegram to test the functionality.  

5. **Troubleshooting**:  
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
   - Verify your JamAI credentials and Telegram bot API key are correct.  
   - Check logs for errors (`logging` is enabled by default).
